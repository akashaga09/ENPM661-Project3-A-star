# Overview

Implemented the A* algorithm for a rigid robot.

# Dependencies

1. numpy library
2. matplotlib library
3. math library
4. scipy library
5. Python 3.8

# Instructions to Run
The inputs are coordinates of start point, orientation of start point, coordinates of goal point, robot radius, clearance, theta (the angle between the action at each node) and step size. All the inputs are float.

The inputs for the start node are 50,30,60 and goal node are 150,150. The radius and clearance are given 1 unit each and step size can be given between 1-9

# Output
The time taken by the algorithm to find the shortest path for default inputs is approximately 9 seconds. The program will display the shortest path after it is found.
